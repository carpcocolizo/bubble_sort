## This one was kind of easy
## Many people would do things different
## But I used mathematical logic behind my code
## It does what is required it compares each pair of number at the time
## And then it runs the code again
## Is a little inneficient as it dosent check if the result is sort
## But runs anyway until it reaches the length of the array
## I think is a clever solution, but not the efficient one
## But I want to leave it that way, as it show some flexibility in my writing
